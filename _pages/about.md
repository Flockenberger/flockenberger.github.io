Hello there :)

I'm Florian, a Master's student in Visual Computing at the Technical University of Vienna. I love combining programming, design, and graphics in creative ways to build interesting projects. Recently, I've also dove into reverse engineering, particularly exploring MMOs (mainly Black Desert Online) and games - from analyzing network packets to digging into binary data.
